SeaNatuners: Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Equipped with Computer Vision for Predictive Maintenance in Offshore Oil and Gas Pipeline Leak Detection - Surabaya, Indonesia

A student innovation program aimed at realizing constructive ideas based on creativity and scientific reasoning through the design and 
development of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The project integrates computer vision techniques to support predictive 
maintenance applications, particularly for detecting potential leaks in offshore oil and gas pipelines. Although the system has not yet 
reached full functional maturity or direct industrial deployment, it serves as a conceptual and experimental platform to demonstrate 
technological feasibility and engineering innovation.

this program 
Developed a thruster control program for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) with 6 degrees of freedom (6-DOF). 
Implemented control signal transmission from camera-based vision processing on a Jetson Nano J1010 to an STM32 microcontroller 
using UART communication protocol.
